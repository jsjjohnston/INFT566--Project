# INFT566--Project
2017 S01 - Assignment - You are required to implement a real time 3-D virtual environment using OpenGL. This application must not be built using a pre-existing game engine, such as Unity3D or Unreal Engine 4. The application must implement the features specified below, but you are able to create whatever environment you wish using pre-existing art assets. 

# Project Features
You are to create an application that makes use of the 3-D knowledge you have gained throughout this subject. There is no theme for the project and you are free to source and use any pre-existing art assets you want.

You are to create the application using base API calls for 3-D rendering.

The application must provide demonstrations of the following, which you will be graded against based on the complexity and technical implementation of each technique:

*You must make use of imported pre-existing 3-D assets that are textured and lit. You are free to source these assets from other students or sources, but **you must have the rights and license** to make use of the assets. You are to include a README document with your application that lists the assets and their sources that you have included with your application. You may also implement other geometry techniques, such as Procedural Generation, Animation and Particle Systems, but you are not limited to those techniques. All assets should also be textured and lit correctly, depending on what they are. You will be graded based on the complexity of the techniques you have implemented.
*You must include real time lighting techniques, **at a minimum** implementing a full Phong lighting model (ambient + diffuse + specular) for **directional and point lights.** You may implement more complex techniques, such as Physically-based Lighting, and you will be awarded more marks based on the complexity and accuracy of the techniques.
*You must include Post-processing. It is up to you what techniques you implement and you will be awarded more marks based on the complexity of the technique. Possible implementations include, **but arenâ€™t limited to**, High Dynamic Range, Depth of Field, Bokeh, Tilt Shift, Motion Blur and other Screen-Space techniques such as Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) and Screen Space Subsurface Scattering (SSSSS).
Some techniques may overlap with each other, and marks will be awarded accordingly.

You will also be graded based on the quality of the code, including internal code documentation and coding standards
